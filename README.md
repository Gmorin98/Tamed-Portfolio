# Tamed-Portfolio
## Design
I really wanted to make a space theme portfolio so I did one. I have stars in the background that twinkle with various random colors. Also choose a font on Google Font that felt like Space/Tech. Tried to keep the design and everything clean, simple and sharp.

## Code
The code inside this website is pretty simple. The most *unique* code would be the twinkle stars. Made it so it's always random for their position, size, color, bloom effect. I also push it to -5 in the Z axis to make sure it doesn't over lap with the actual website.

## Other
*I plan to redo the portfolio once class is over, I see bigger ahah.*
